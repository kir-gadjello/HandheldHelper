# Handheld Helper

Basic AI capability should be owned by everyone.

An AI that fits in the palm of your hand.

This is a prototype of minimalistic cross-platform chat application (tested on Android, Linux, MacOS) written in Flutter that uses a heavily customized llama.cpp as a built-in inference engine. Initially it was developed for use on my own hardware in November 2023, due to inadequacy and clunkiness of solutions for on-device LLMs, especially Android, at the time. Updating to the recent version of llama.cpp has caused problems with the support of less standard models like Phi; to be resolved.

Basic functionality provided:

- Model selection
- Chat template selection
- System message customization
- Stopping generation
- HTML code execution in a pop-up window
- Search over historical chats
- Default model download from Huggingface
